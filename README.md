Techniques to solve simple problems without external libraries

For much simple problems in LUA I search response and not get adequate answers without use external libraries.
For that reasion I resolved post here all implementations more simple possible for that problems without use
that external libraries.
Because complicate if you simplify the things.
LUA is sweet for hundreds of applications and need continue simple same not getting all big standard libraries for
much other languages for example: JAVA, C, C++, Python, JavaScript...
My expectation is that to be util for any person that use that language.
