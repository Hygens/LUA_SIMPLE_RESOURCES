Techniques to solve simple problems without external libraries

For much simple problems in LUA I search for adequate answers without use external libraries but without success. For that reaction I resolved post here all implementations more simple possible for problems without external libraries. Because complicate if you can simplify the things. LUA is sweet for hundreds of applications and need continue simple same not having all big standard libraries for much other languages for example: JAVA, C, C++, Python, JavaScript... My expectation is that to be useful for any person that use in your day by day.
